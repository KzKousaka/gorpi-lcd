gorpi-lcd
=========

The online Adafruit LCD tutorial uses an Python example: http://learn.adafruit.com/drive-a-16x2-lcd-directly-with-a-raspberry-pi

I wanted to stick with the new language I'd been learning (Google Go).  

So I found a gpio library (http://github.com/davecheney/gpio), and updated it a bit along then worked up this 
LCD program that you can use to drive the LCD panel.

See example files under /examples for .. well examples.

This has been tested to work with the same hardware given in the adafruit tutorial.  Other hardware.. YMMV!
